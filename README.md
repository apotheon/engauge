## Currently Using

* ruby 2.2.2p95 (2015-04-13 revision 50295) [x86_64-freebsd10.1]
* Rails 4.2.4
* postgres (PostgreSQL) 9.4.4


## Setup

### Environment

0.  Set up your Ruby environment.

        $ rbenv local 2.2.2     # example using rbenv

1.  Make sure you have PostgreSQL working on your system.  On some systems you
    may be able to let Rails install PostgreSQL related requirements for you,
    and thus skip to step 2.

2.  Install Rails.

        gem install rails

### Gems

    $ bundle install
